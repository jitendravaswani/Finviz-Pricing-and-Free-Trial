## Finviz: Top Features

Finviz has awesome tools to make trading easier. Here’s what stands out:

Fast Stock Screener - The screener searches over 8,500 stocks quickly. Filter by price, volume, or growth—like finding stocks under $5 or ones that jumped 20%. It has over 60 filters, and you can save searches like “Tech Winners” for later.

Colorful Heatmaps - Heatmaps use colors to show market trends—green for stocks going up, red for those going down. You can check sectors like tech or energy and see stocks, ETFs, or crypto trends in one glance.

Powerful Charts - Charts come with over 50 tools, like moving averages or RSI, to spot trends. They help you find patterns, like price jumps, to time your trades. You can also compare stocks, like Tesla vs. Apple, on one screen.

Insider Trading Info - See what company leaders are buying (green) or selling (red), with dates. Big buys, like a CEO spending $1M, might mean good news. You can check official reports for more details.

More Than Just Stocks - Finviz tracks currencies (like USD/EUR), futures (like oil), and crypto (like Bitcoin). It shows how these markets connect, with heatmaps and charts for everything in one place.

Easy to Use - The layout is simple for beginners but powerful for pros. The homepage shows top stocks, losers, and news right away. It works well on phones or computers, so you can trade anywhere.
